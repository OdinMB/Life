# Life
A strategic, rogue-like life simulation. Early design phase.

I'm looking for partners in crime to create a prototype for this potential indie game. Please reach out if you're interested!

I would like to create awareness for the role that privilege plays in our lives, and I think game mechanics could be a powerful tool for that. Specifically, I'm thinking about a turn-based, rogue-like life simulation that uses mechanics from Civilization games. It would be an engine builder that, depending on the starting conditions, makes it possible to achieve all of your dreams if you play your cards right, or hard to even stay aflout. In addition to promoting empathy, I believe that such a game would also be a lot of fun. After all, this whole life thing is just meant to be turned into a proper strategy game!
